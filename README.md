## Overview

### About the game

Players take turns rolling the die.

Each player has two scores, total score and current score.

For a player to win the game they need to accumulate a total score of 100.

To do this each player takes turns rolling the die.

During each turn a player can roll the dice as many times as they like. Each die roll is added to their current score.

If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0 and the turn is passed to the next player.

A player can choose to hold their score before a 1 is rolled. This score is then banked and added to their total score.

Once a player reaches a total score of 100 they are declared the winner.

A new game can be commenced by pressing the "New Game" button which resets the game to the initial state.
